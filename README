Bucket List

This is the bucket list application I've been working on to practice using Django.

Current Features:
 - Add and delete items and lists
 - Personal lists unique to users
 - Optional descriptions and URLs for items
 - Mark favorite lists for easy lookup
 - Check off completed items
 - Search for items
 - Sharing viewable list to non-registered users
 - Edit item details on same page
 - Sharing edit permissions with registered users
