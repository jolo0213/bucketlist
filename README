Bucket List

This is the bucket list application I've been working on to practice using Django.

Current Features:
 - users can add and delete items and lists
 - each user has their own lists
 - items can have optional URLs or descriptions
 - users can mark favorite lists for easy lookup
 - users can check off which items have been completed
 - users can search for items (not lists)
 - users can share a link to a list to other people who don't need to be registered

Future Additions:
 - edit item descriptions without leaving list screen (quick edit)
 - sharing edit permissions with logged in users
